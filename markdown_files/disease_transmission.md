## A Background of Disease Transmission

Host-pathogen models were first developed at the beginning of the 20th century to anticipate the next move of a disease system, and possibly prevent it [38]. These models fully took transmission into account, with the idea that understanding how a pathogen works could perpetuate effective control measures [38]. Pathogen transmission is a key process that influences host-pathogen interactions and thus the modeling of infectious diseases [38]. Central to disease biology, disease ecology, epidemiology, biological data science, and health informatics, modes of pathogen transmission are significantly complex [3]. Transmission factors have a key role in disease systems, affecting epidemic spread, outbreak fade-outs and persistence of a pathogen [2]. As an object of natural selection, pathogen transmission fluctuates and changes rapidly depending on specific disease systems and the dynamics of those systems [2]. As a subset of the evolutionary nature of pathogens, transmission modes are subjected to natural selection, leading to various subtypes of pathogen transmission [3]. Within the field of public health, pathogen transmission modes are the method with which pathogens use to move from
host to host [3]. Often confused with transmission modes are transmission routes, which are the paths that pathogens take using a specific mode, moving a pathogen from a
starting point to an ending destination [3]. Routes use modes of transmission, providing a wholistic and conceptual view of how a pathogen affects a population, whereas
modes of transmission are more pathogen and disease based. In essence, transmission modes define the characteristics associated with a specific pathogen, while transmission
routes dictate how a pathogen will leave one host and infect another [3]. Transmission routes are unique, ever-changing and can be difficult to a specific infectious disease
system; however, pathogen transmission modes are generally classifiable, and provide a unique insight into host-pathogen interactions.
Modes of pathogen transmission can be placed into two broad categories: vertical and horizontal transmission [3]. The most straightforward of the two—vertical transmission—relates to the passage of a pathogen from a mother to offspring as a form of infection inheritance [18]. Horizontal transmission accounts for a majority of modes,
as a pathogen is spread from the interactions between hosts [3]. This classification of transmission mode can be divided into even more specific sub-categories, including
sexual and non-sexual, airborne, indirect, environmental, fomites—common items such as clothing, utensils and furniture, that are likely to carry infection—and vector-borne modes [3]. These sub-categories are often grouped as direct and indirect transmission to assist in the identification and understanding of specific pathogen transmission routes. Direct transmission combines the theory of horizontal transmission, with that of host-to-host contact. In comparison, indirect transmission focuses on the interaction between hosts and pathogen reservoirs, such as airborne particles, fomites, and disease vectors [3]. Direct and indirect modes are common classifications for pathogen
transmission of a disease system; however, it is often the case that frequency-dependent and density-dependent theories are be applied to a specific disease system. Pathogen
transmission, in many ways, is linked to the encounters between susceptible hosts and vectors, reservoir hosts or infected hosts, all which are proponents of the environment
that a population is in, which can be represented in a variety of ways [52]. While pathogen transmission modes provide insight into host-pathogen interactions, disease
modeling specifically provides insight into the progression of a disease, and the possible outcomes associated with an infectious disease outbreak. There exist two classes of epidemic modeling used to capture the dynamic of infection in populations: deterministic and stochastic models [52].
Deterministic models attempt to describe the trends of an infectious disease at the population scale on average, with no randomness expected [53]. In deterministic
modeling, predictions are entirely dictated by the initial conditions of the model, including underlying equations and input parameter values [56]. Unlike deterministic
models, stochastic models rely on individual variation of exposure risk, disease, and other factors as input, expecting that there are fluctuations in disease systems [53]. Stochastic disease models expect that infectious diseases are often random in nature, leading to highly complex equations, and occasionally unknown parameters [53]. While
deterministic disease models are traditionally applied in the public health field, using
computational models to reveal patterns in random disease systems is growing in popularity as infectious disease prevalence is also on the rise. Though, while stochastic
and dynamic disease models are often more dynamic in predicting disease outbreaks, deterministic disease models are more accessible for undergraduate students without
previous knowledge of disease modeling.
