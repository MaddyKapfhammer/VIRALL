Essential to identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventative healthcare is disease modeling, which permits the description of how an infectious disease spreads throughout a population over time [39]. Mathematical modeling of outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics provides an avenue to make predictions about a given disease
system, while understanding its trajectory over time; both of which are crucial for implementing policy and prevention measures that will control the spread of disease
[39]. For more than 100 years mathematical models have been used to show the trends of infectious disease dynamics [8]. Deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE)
models are used to show the dynamics of populations experiencing infectious disease over time, depicting the movement of a pathogen throughout a community [32].
Deterministic disease modeling, which employ the use of ODE models includes two subtypes of modeling, the first which accounts for density-dependent transmission and
the second which accounts for frequency-dependent transmission [28]. Many host parasite systems assume that transmission increases, both directly and indirectly, with an
increase in host population density, relating directly to density-dependent transmission [49]. With entirely direct transmission, this theory is valid if contact between hosts
increases as host density increases; however, most pathogens are spread via vectors and reservoir hosts rather than from direct contact with a previously infected hosts [49].
Additionally, biological infectious disease systems are complex, and often facilitate multiple types of direct and indirect transmission modes [2]. As density-dependent trans-
mission cannot be the sole determinant of pathogen transmission, frequency-dependent
theories suggest that transmission of a pathogen is a component of the rate of interaction between hosts, which is unaffected by host density [49].
Mathematical formulas, specifically differential equations, which map a scenario over a specific time span, can describe the transition of individuals in a population
through a disease system and stages of infection. This transition is described as compartmental disease modeling, defined by the movement of individuals through “compartments” that are classified by infection status [8]. The formalized concept of a compartmental, mathematical model is that a set of ordinary differential equations
cab be used to describe the behavior of a disease outbreak [39]. Compartmental modeling is "elegant and simple," permitting designers and users to expand them with
ease, often by connecting additional compartments [8]. Only one individual can be in a single compartment at a given time; however, compartmental models are applauded
for their ability to consider the transition of an individual from one compartment to
another while also tracking the corresponding population sizes through time [8]. Mathematical disease models, specifically compartmental models, describe population-
level dynamics of infectious diseases [8]. Most mathematical models are based on three compartments of a population affected by an infectious disease: susceptible, infectious,
and recovered, which was inspired by Kermack and McKenrick in 1927 [8]. Kermack and McKendrik formalized the concept of the compartmental model by using a set of
differential equations to describe the behavior of a disease outbreak [39]. Compartmental disease modeling takes into account the number of individuals in their disease
status compartments, in addition to the rates associated with infectious disease system
dynamics [32]. With disease rates, comes the ability for an individual to move from one compartment to another.
